**Abstract**:
Despite Bengali being the sixth most spoken language in the world, handwritten text recognition (HTR) systems for Bengali remain severely underdeveloped. The complexity of Bengali script—featuring conjuncts, diacritics, and highly variable handwriting styles—combined with a scarcity of annotated datasets makes this task particularly challenging. We present **GraDeT-HTR**, a resource-efficient Bengali handwritten text recognition system based on a **Gra**pheme-aware **De**coder-only **T**ransformer architecture. To address the unique challenges of Bengali script, we integrate a grapheme-based tokenizer and demonstrate that it significantly improves recognition accuracy compared to conventional subword tokenizers. Our model is pretrained on large-scale synthetic data and fine-tuned on real human-annotated samples, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets.
